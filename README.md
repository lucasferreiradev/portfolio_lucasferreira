##Resume
###This is an work made to improve my skills on front end development using basically only HTML, CSS and JS.

##Concept
###As a web developer I tried to apply many concepts in this project however to looks more clean and readable at the same time using some effects in different ways to create a functional and interesting page.

##Colour
###I choose the colour white for menu background and to contrast blue for text e a red (tomato) in details and effets.
###The same idea was applied to the main page however a light blue was chosen as a background color.
###This colours work very well together and the content can be read withou problems, remebering that, the tomato colour is the only high contrast in the page.

##Layout
###The layout looks simple and sophisticated, but the way that I decide do present make all difference. Instead off a menu on top, I put on the left fixed so the user must click in each section to see each page, without or scrolling as less as possible.
###The benefits of this strategy can be multiple but to me as a developer, I try to provide to user more interactions without tiring the user with too much content which can distract him.
###The responsive concept was designed in the same way we have a menu button that can be reach on the top left, and the user can go to any page without scrolling.
###I divided in 6 parts (Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, Hobbies, Contact)

##GDPR
###All the images used were made by my in the past or used in previous jobs that I've done.
###The icons were taken from Font Awesome.
